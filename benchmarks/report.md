### Findings

- Auto classification matched the expected type (gameplay) with confidence 0.97.
- Subtitle checker reported warnings (38), but no hard failure.
- Face-aware rendering completed, but actual face detections were sparse (45/2258 sampled checks), so this benchmark does not strongly validate facecam tracking quality.
- All rendered benchmark scenarios produced the requested subtitled clips.

## Human Review / Selection Quality

- Records with complete human scores: `5`
- Minimum recommended complete records before weight tuning: `10`
- Human-review signal is still small, so this iteration uses conservative rules and diagnostics rather than aggressive weight tuning.
- Auto records with complete human scores: `5`
- Current template complete records: `1` / `110`; archive complete records: `4` / `4`
- Average human scores: relevance `2.60`, boundary `2.80`, crop `3.80`

### Reviewed Averages

- Content type `gameplay` (`n=5`): relevance `2.60`, boundary `2.80`, crop `3.80`
- Scenario `auto` (`n=5`): relevance `2.60`, boundary `2.80`, crop `3.80`

### Note Issues

- `bad boundary`: `3`
- `buy menu`: `2`
- `weak payoff`: `2`
- `setup / waiting`: `2`
- `smoke / utility`: `2`

### Data-Backed Top Problems

- Scoring chooses setup / ad-like / weak-payoff clips too often. (`score=11.40`)
- Clip boundaries still start too early or end too weakly. (`score=5.20`)
- Crop / framing still hurts readability on reviewed clips. (`score=1.20`)

### High Score / Low Relevance

- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `2` (05:25.33 - 05:58.35) | local `92.97` vs human relevance `2`
- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `4` (02:17.46 - 02:52.19) | local `92.62` vs human relevance `1`
- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `5` (04:14.05 - 04:59.95) | local `92.07` vs human relevance `2`

### Iteration Changes

- Human review preservation now also recovers complete scored rows from the previous `benchmarks/results.json`, so historical manual scores are archived even if the CSV archive file is missing.
- The report now marks small human-review samples explicitly and lists the next clips to review instead of presenting low-N tuning as statistically strong.
- Local scoring adds conservative penalties for ad/sponsor-like text, gameplay setup/waiting/smoke/utility, weak payoff, too much preamble and contextless talk-led clips.
- Local scoring adds small positive signals for gameplay action/payoff, tutorial instructions, podcast question-response shape and complete commentary thoughts.
- Boundary refinement now records `max_duration_clamped` and can trim a low-value gameplay opening when a later action/payoff remains inside the clip.

### Ranking Movement

- Not enough complete human review exists to claim a statistically strong ranking improvement. Use the next review pass to verify whether the new penalties demote setup/ad-like/weak-payoff clips.

### Next Human Review Targets

- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `1` (18:03.49 - 18:35.79) | expected `gameplay` | local `95.95`
- `canva_presentation_tutorial/auto` clip `1` (07:31.31 - 08:07.91) | expected `tutorial` | local `67.14`
- `magenta_team_podcast/auto` clip `1` (02:10.86 - 02:46.86) | expected `podcast` | local `85.58`
- `ukraine_war_report/auto` clip `1` (17:40.72 - 18:16.46) | expected `commentary` | local `83.0`
- `putin_parade_commentary/auto` clip `1` (06:57.53 - 07:47.13) | expected `commentary` | local `73.9`
- `roman_giertych_commentary/auto` clip `1` (19:54.36 - 20:31.18) | expected `commentary` | local `80.4`
- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `2` (05:37.91 - 06:14.94) | expected `gameplay` | local `94.29`
- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `4` (04:14.05 - 04:59.95) | expected `gameplay` | local `92.7`
- `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `5` (15:02.36 - 15:33.76) | expected `gameplay` | local `92.36`
- `canva_presentation_tutorial/auto` clip `2` (25:46.46 - 26:22.20) | expected `tutorial` | local `66.87`
- `canva_presentation_tutorial/auto` clip `3` (09:56.17 - 10:31.10) | expected `tutorial` | local `66.6`
- `canva_presentation_tutorial/auto` clip `4` (17:25.96 - 18:01.94) | expected `tutorial` | local `66.07`

- Biggest remaining problem after this iteration: `scoring` (Scoring chooses setup / ad-like / weak-payoff clips too often.)

## Selection Quality Tuning

- Complete human-review records available: `5`
- Tuning basis: defensive heuristics plus the existing human-review notes; the scored sample is too small for aggressive weight tuning.
- Scoring changes: ad/sponsor, buy-menu, setup/waiting, smoke/utility, weak-payoff, long-preamble and contextless-fragment penalties; small boosts for gameplay action/payoff, tutorial instruction language, podcast dialogue shape and complete commentary thoughts.
- Boundary metadata: `original_start`, `original_end`, `refined_start`, `refined_end`, `boundary_adjustment_reason`, `sentence_boundary_used`, `speaker_turn_boundary_used`, `max_duration_clamped`.
- Boundary behavior: talk-led clips are aligned to transcript sentence/segment boundaries; gameplay clips can trim low-value setup while keeping a short pre-roll before action.
- Fresh human review should prioritize:
  - `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `1` (18:03.49 - 18:35.79) | expected `gameplay` | local `95.95`
  - `canva_presentation_tutorial/auto` clip `1` (07:31.31 - 08:07.91) | expected `tutorial` | local `67.14`
  - `magenta_team_podcast/auto` clip `1` (02:10.86 - 02:46.86) | expected `podcast` | local `85.58`
  - `ukraine_war_report/auto` clip `1` (17:40.72 - 18:16.46) | expected `commentary` | local `83.0`
  - `putin_parade_commentary/auto` clip `1` (06:57.53 - 07:47.13) | expected `commentary` | local `73.9`
  - `roman_giertych_commentary/auto` clip `1` (19:54.36 - 20:31.18) | expected `commentary` | local `80.4`
  - `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `2` (05:37.91 - 06:14.94) | expected `gameplay` | local `94.29`
  - `emeritos_gameplay/auto` clip `4` (04:14.05 - 04:59.95) | expected `gameplay` | local `92.7`

## Review Dashboard

- Generate a local review dashboard with `python review_dashboard.py export-html`.
- Append review feedback with `python review_dashboard.py add-review --clip-id CLIP_ID --rating 4 --good-clip true --notes "..."`.
- Reviews are stored append-only in `benchmarks/human_reviews.jsonl`.

## Recommendation

- Next step: `more_human_review`
- Title: Score more benchmark clips before stronger tuning
- Why: Only 5 complete human-review records are available; at least 10 are recommended before larger scoring changes.
